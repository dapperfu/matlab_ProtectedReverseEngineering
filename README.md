# .p Reverse Engineering

For reverse engineering .p files.

Despite what the lawyers think, sometime it's just for learning. Or Devops. (Blame Devops).

# Workflow:

1. Rename all ```*.p``` files as ```*2.p```.
2. Create ```*.m``` file in ```.p``` file's place.
3. Some ```varargin```, ```nargouts```, and ```dbstop`` stuffs.
4. Profit.

## Caveats

Do different stuffs for OOP things.

## Successes

- Licensing bits for [NXP's Model-Based Design Toolbox](https://www.nxp.com/design/automotive-software-and-tools/model-based-design-toolbox:MC_TOOLBOX) for DevOps bits.


## Legal

If you read the fine print of where ever you got the .p file, you probably shouldn't do this.
